## Introduction
The goal of this project is to understand customer behavior by segmenting customers into distinct groups and predicting their behavior. These insights can help the company in targeted marketing and personalized offers.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The customer data is collected from a SQLite database. The preprocessing involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

## Customer Segmentation
Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) are used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and characteristics.

## Predictive Modeling
Predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) are built to forecast customer behavior, such as the likelihood of churn or probability of purchase.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the predictive models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Data Visualization
Visualizations are created to present the results of customer segmentation and predictive modeling.

## Reporting
The findings and visualizations are compiled into a comprehensive report.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- sqlite3
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
